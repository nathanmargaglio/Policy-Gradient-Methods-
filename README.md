# Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning
An implementation of the "[Policy Gradient Methods for Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1713-policy-gradient-methods-for-reinforcement-learning-with-function-approximation.pdf)" paper.

The [RL.ipynb notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nathanmargaglio/Policy-Gradient-Methods-for-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/RL.ipynb) walks through the implementation of the paper.
